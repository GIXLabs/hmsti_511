# Tuesday Synchronous Remote (90 minutes)
- 20 minutes: 3D printer setting activity.
    - What is this activity?
        - Needs to be interactive
        - Have a submission
        - Preamble and motivation for the lecture on settings
        - Explore the Bambu Studio settings individually before pairing and grouping to discuss.
            - Pick a setting you think is important, but not one you think anyone else will pick.
            - Read the page on the Bambu wiki (hover over the setting in Bambu Studio, then follow the link that pops up).
            - On Canvas
                - Which setting did you explore?
                - In your words, what does it do?
                - Why do you think it is important?
- 15 minutes: Lecture on 3D printer settings.
    - Layer height
    - Support enabled
    - Wall count
    - Kinds of support (tree vs normal)
    - Bed adhesion
- 15 minutes: Lecture on low-fidelity techniques in 3D printing.
    - Testing sub-assemblies (print small parts to reduce uncertainty)
    - Low wall count (unless strength is the uncertainty)
    - Large layer heights (you won't notice the difference, but it'll be faster)

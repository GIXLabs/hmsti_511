# Overview
As a remote course where you will often need to show work in class through pictures, it will be important for you to have a good feel for how to quickly and accurately get a physical object into an image you can share through Zoom.
 
# Instructions
Take three pictures of a cup. Two with your phone and one with your webcam. In each picture, vary the angle and background. With the phone pictures, include one with the flash on and one with the flash off.

Take two pictures of a sketch (can be of whatever you'd like, maybe a smiley face if you don't have something else you'd like to draw). In one picture, use your phone, in the other use your webcam.

Submit these photos here on Canvas, as well as describe what combination you will use in class.

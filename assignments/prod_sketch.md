# Overview
One of the cheapest and fastest prototypes is a hand-drawn sketch. Hand sketches can be used to communicate ideas, particularly in meetings, to collect details like measurements prior to CAD, and to explore many potential forms quickly.

The one big downside of hand sketching is the skill to do them, but you can get value out of hand sketching even without spending many hours developing skills. 

# Instructions
Pick an object to draw. This should not be an overly simple object like a cell phone, but rather one with more complex shapes, like an old-school rotary phone. You will be using this object for all of your sketches.
1. Sketch 1: Try to draw it in whatever way you'd like.
1. Sketch 2: Use an orthographic projection style.
1. Sketch 3: Sketch the object as a combination of simple 3D solids.
1. Sketch 4: Sketch the object with vanishing points.

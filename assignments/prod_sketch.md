# Overview
One of the cheapest and fastest prototypes is a hand-drawn sketch. Hand sketches can be used to communicate ideas, particularly in meetings, to collect details like measurements prior to CAD, and to explore many potential forms quickly.

The one big downside of hand sketching is the skill to do them, but you can get value out of hand sketching even without spending many hours developing skills. 

# Instructions
Pick an object to draw. This should not be an overly simple object like a cell phone, but rather one with more complex shapes, like an old-school rotary phone. You will be using this object for all of your sketches.
1. Sketch 1: Try to draw it in whatever way you'd like.
1. Sketch 2: Use an orthographic projection style.
1. Sketch 3: Sketch the object as a combination of simple 3D solids.
1. Sketch 4: Sketch the object with 2 vanishing points.

# Rubric
| Points | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Sketch 1 |
| 1 | Sketch 2 |
| 1 | Sketch 3 |
| 1 | Sketch 4 |

Note: The intention is that you spend around 15 minutes on each sketch, something you can fit into a break at work. As long as it looks like about that amount of effort has been exerted, you will get full points. Anything less, or more, will result in partial credit.

# Instructor Note
Each of these sketches will be due on consecutive days. This assignment write-up will actually be 4 assignments.

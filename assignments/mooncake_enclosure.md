# Overview
Most products are designed to be interacted with by humans. This adds a layer of complexity requiring considered design and construction. In this assignment, you will move beyond stacked construction in order to create more complex 3D forms out of 2D sheet materials. While trying to solve practical problems of shape, form, and function, you will continue to hone your low and medium-fidelity prototyping skills, and build rationale for your design decisions.

Scenario: The hotel you designed mooncakes for is thrilled with your design and has asked you to design packaging to go with it. Your design should include one or more moving parts, such as a hinged/sliding/pivoting feature that adds to the interaction experience. You can embellish the enclosure however you wish, perhaps incorporating surface designs and internal structural cushioning and bracing.

Your design should take cues from the mooncake itself: Who is the target customer of your hotel's mooncakes? Are there any existing brand elements that could be continued into the packaging? How are customers expected to interact with it? Whatever your intent, you should be able to explain and justify it.

The hotel is particularly worried about intellectual property (they don't want to be sued), so you will need to create a unique design and cite any sources of inspiration.

Your final prototype should be produced to a good standard of quality that functions as designed and demonstrates attention to detail and craftsmanship. The final version should open and close easily and display stability in normal use. 

# Examples

Note: these are all from previous versions of the assignment that involved enclosing beverage bottles and phones. Yours should enclose your 6 mooncakes.

Slat pattern to produce "animation" when opening.

Clever use of rope stitching to create a hinge (though you should have a lasercut mechanism too)

Nice use of springs to provide a dramatic opening experience.

Rack and pinion mechanism to reveal bottle.

# Learning Objectives
- Be able to choose the appropriate approach for different stages of the design process
- Demonstrate competence with materials and fabrication processes available to you at GIX
- Be able to explain the benefits and limitations of using different media and prototyping methods
- Be able to adapt or create new designs to accommodate existing or new constraints
- Be able to justify design decisions and articulate a convincing case for design considerations
- Practice 3D modeling skills.
- Practice creating 3D objects from flat materials.

# Constraints
- Final design must be made of flat, sheet materials - plywood, acrylic, cardboard, etc.
- Must contain at least one joint, hinge, pivot, drawer or similar feature.
- Packaging must enclose your 6 mooncakes from A2.1.
- The design should be your own, though starting from a box generator is ok. Provide a link to any box generators or other sources you used.
- No 3D printing.

    - Demonstrate during critiques
    - Participate in peer critiques
    - Fill out critique reflection on Canvas

# Use of Existing Resources

You may use an existing box generator as a starting point for your enclosure. You may use existing designs as design inspirations for your work. You may not download an existing file and simply modify it slightly and present it as your own work.

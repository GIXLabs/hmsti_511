# Overview



# Instructions
- Watch video on using calipers
- Answer the following questions:
    - Does this number seem right? Y/N
        - [Image of caliper reading a number that's too small, possibly negative]()
    - What's the likely problem?
        - Low battery.
        - Using the wrong part of the caliper to measure.
        - The calipers aren't zeroed properly.
    - Which part of the calipers would you use to measure the outer dimension of this cup?
    - Which part of the calipers would you use to measure the inner diameter of this cup?
    - Which part of the calipers would you use to measure the depth of this cup?

1. Grab a simple cup or glass and a coaster (or similar object) to use for practice.
1. Calipers are commonly used tools for measuring precise lengths. 
1. Check for grit on the jaws and make sure it reads 0 when closed.
    1. Common mistakes that result in wrong measurements.
    1. Wipe off if dirty.
    1. Reset if not going to zero.
    1. You can change between metric and imperial depending on which you prefer.
1. What happens when you try to close the jaws really hard?
    1. You generally only want to use enough force to keep the jaws flat on whatever you're measuring and no more.
1. Most common use is measuring the outside dimensions of something.
    1. Open the jaws and press them against outside edges of the cup and submit that measurement here.
    1. Make sure the jaws are as flat against the object as they can be. This might be challenging on a tapered glass.
1. Use the inside jaws to measure the inside diameter of the
1. Use the spike on the bottom to measure the depth of the cup.
1. Use the step to measure the height of the cup from the outside.
1. Use Fusion to draw a cross section of the cup. If you had a tapered cup, you can assume that the walls are vertical using the measurements at the top of the cup.

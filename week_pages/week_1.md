# Week 1: Why Prototyping and Low Fidelity

## Overview
This week, we will learn a few techniques for low fidelity prototyping and investigate why low fidelity prototyping matters. We also learn about and practice critiquing.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week you will be able to do the following:
- Describe what low fidelity prototyping is and when to use it.
- Apply a few low fidelity prototyping approaches.
- Use hand sketches to convey ideas.
- Give and received feedback.
- Measure existing objects using calipers.

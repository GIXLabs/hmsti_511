# Week 4: Introduction to 3D Printing

## Overview
This week, we will start to explore the use of 3D printing in prototyping. 3D printing has many disadvantages and design considerations that we will start to get into this week.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week you will be able to do the following:
- Describe some constraints around 3D printing.
- Explain how 3D printing fit into the prototyping process.
- Determine whether a 3D model has a good chance of printing successfully.
- Design a part for 3D printing.
- Describe the steps involved in 3D printing.

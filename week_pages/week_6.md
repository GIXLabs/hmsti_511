# Week 6: Mass Manufacturing Techniques
## Overview
This week, we start to exit the realm of prototyping and enter the world of mass manufacturing.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week you will be able to do the following:
- List several mass manufacturing techniques.
- Identify the manufacturing technique used to produce items in your environment.
- Create basic toolpaths for CNC routing.

## Deliverables
| Due Date | Due Time | Title (linked in final) | Requires Class Participation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tuesday | 11:00 PM | Reflection on Manufacturing Exercise | Yes |
| Monday (week 7) | 11:00 PM | Final Project Proposals |  |	
| Friday (week 7) | 11:00 PM | Toolpaths for CNC |  |	

## Tuesday Class Prep
Bring final project ideas.

## Media to Produce
Possibly a survey of mass manufacturing techniques, but might be better to use YouTube videos since we donâ€™t have the equipment.

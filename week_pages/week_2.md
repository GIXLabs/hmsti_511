# Week 2: Working with Sheet Materials and Lasers
## Overview
This week, we will explore prototyping using laser cutting. Along the way, we’ll learn more about working with the 2D design tools in CAD. We will also explore using prototypes to answer specific questions.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week you will be able to do the following:
- Describe the advantages and disadvantages of laser cutting for prototyping.
- Design parts in CAD for laser cutting.
- Create parts that fit with an existing PCB.
- Design a 3D shape using stacked materials.

# Syllabus
## Course Overview
The course develops core skills and abilities in fabricating and prototyping interactive systems for technology innovation. You will learn the how and why of physical prototyping and how these principles apply outside the realm of physical fabrication. 

You will develop prototypes using additive and subtractive manufacturing processes, and a variety of media including paper/wood, architectural foam, vacuum-formed plastic, 3D printing, laser cutting, and more. Throughout the course, you will engage with these materials and techniques, employing appropriate methods for different stages and iterations of the user-centered design process.

Much of the iterative processes you will learn rely on getting feedback from stakeholders, so there is also an emphasis on giving, receiving, and acting on feedback through a critique culture throughout this course.

## Course Structure
This course is structured into weekly modules consisting of:
- One synchronous remote session (90 mins) via Zoom/Teams
- One Saturday in-person session (180 mins, every other weekend)
- Asynchronous activities (guided assignments, lectures, and quizzes)

## Course Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, you will:
- Use physical prototyping to resolve problems, communicate ideas, and improve designs.
- Know and recall basic techniques and processes, terms, and concepts used in rapid prototyping and manufacturing.
- Be able to explain the benefits and limitations of using different media and prototyping methods.
- Be able to justify design decisions and articulate a convincing case for design considerations.
- Be able to choose the appropriate approach for different stages of the design process.
- Be able to adapt or create new designs to accommodate existing or new constraints.
- Be able to analyze an existing designed artifact and explain which processes were used to create it.
- Demonstrate competence with materials and fabrication processes available to you at GIX.
- Be able to explain the values of engineering drawings and when they are needed.
